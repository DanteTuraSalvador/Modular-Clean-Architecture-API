**This API serves as a demonstration and educational resource for showcasing modern API development practices using .NET and Domain-Driven Design principles.** It provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing resources. It follows RESTful principles to ensure a predictable and easy-to-use interface for developers and utilizes a **Service-Based Implementation**.

## Key Features and Design Patterns

* **Resource Management:** Offers full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for key entities within the application, with business logic encapsulated within dedicated **Services**.
* **Service-Based Implementation:** The API employs a service layer (e.g., `IEmployeeRoleService`) that contains the core business logic, separating it from the controller's responsibility of handling HTTP requests and responses. This promotes better organization, testability, and maintainability.
* **Rich Domain Model with Value Objects:** The API leverages a rich domain model where entities encapsulate behavior and data. It also utilizes **Value Objects** to represent immutable domain concepts (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, monetary values), promoting better domain modeling and reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
* **Data Validation:** Implements robust server-side validation within the service layer (and potentially using middleware in the API) to ensure data integrity and provide informative error messages for invalid requests, potentially utilizing **Guard Clauses** for early exit and clear validation logic.
* **Error Handling:** Provides consistent and structured error responses using standard HTTP status codes and `ProblemDetails` for easier debugging and integration, often leveraging a **Result Pattern** (`Result<T>`) to encapsulate operation outcomes with potential errors returned from the service layer.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Built with asynchronous operations throughout the API and service layer for improved performance and scalability.
* **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Utilizes DTOs to define clear contracts for request and response payloads, facilitating data transfer between the API and the service layer.
* **Efficient Data Mapping:** Leverages a mapping library (e.g., Mapster) for streamlined object transformations between DTOs and domain entities (including **Value Objects**) within the service layer.
* **Well-Documented:** Designed with API documentation in mind, making it easy for developers to understand and integrate (likely using Swagger/OpenAPI).
* **Pagination (for Collections):** Supports retrieving large datasets in manageable chunks with pagination parameters handled by the service layer and reflected in the API response.
* **Filtering and Sorting (for Collections):** Offers options to filter and sort collections of resources, with the filtering and sorting logic often implemented using the **Specification Pattern** within the service layer to encapsulate query logic.
* **HATEOAS (for Collection Endpoints):** Implements Hypermedia links in collection responses to enable discoverability of related resources and navigation, often generated within the controller based on data from the service layer.
* **Strongly-Typed IDs (Potentially):** Employs strongly-typed IDs for enhanced type safety and domain clarity, used consistently throughout the API and service layer, potentially as **Value Objects**.
* **Domain-Driven Design (Inspired):** Organized with a focus on the domain, separating concerns and encapsulating business logic within the **Service-Based Implementation** and a rich domain model with **Value Objects**, likely interacting with data through **Repositories** for persistence abstraction managed by a **Unit of Work** pattern within the service layer.
